ION_mail
========

Program to send mail using launching module in ION Enterprise or PME

It takes three external files to work.

1. m_body.html

This file contains the body of the mail, for a better presentation it must be an html file, so we can customize it.

2. m_message.txt

This file contains the list of messages that can be desplayed on the message related to some given event.

3. m_serverconfig.txt

This file contains the server configuration values like SMTP Server IP, sender name, destination list and Timezone
(in my file I use GMT -5 for Per√∫)


CALLING THE PROGRAM FROM Launching Module
=========================================

Link two inputs to Launching Module:

1. Event: This is a numeric value, it is the event code to search in the m_message.txt

2. Timestamp: This is a numeric value, it represents the value in seconds since 1st Jan 1970
